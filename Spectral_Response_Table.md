### General Spectral Response of Common Terrain Features

|Terrain Feature | Reflectance Response |
| :---: | :--- |
| Water | Generally reflects highest in the visible spectrum, however, clear water has lower reflectance than turbid water.  In the NIR and Mid-IR regions water increasingly absorbs the light.  Higher amounts of dissolved inorganic materials in water bodies tends to shift the peak of visible reflectance toward the red region from the green region (clearer water) of the spectrum.
| Soil | Northern latitudes have black soils and tropical regions have red soils.  Soil reflectance decreases as organic matter increases.  As soil moisture increases, reflectance of soil decreases at all wavelengths.  Texture of soil will cause increased reflectance with decreased particle size, i.e., the bigger particles (rocks, sand, and soils) basically cast a larger shadow.|
| Vegetation| The spectral reflectance is based on the chlorophyll and water absorption in the leaf. Chlorophyll refects NIR energy and the water content reflects SWIR energy. Needles have a darker response than leaves.  Age and plant stress can affect spectral characteristics across the spectrum, but is generally most noticable in NIR. Leaf size, shape, oritentation, etc. can also affect reflectance |
|Man-Made Materials|Concrete and asphalt both display spectral curves that generally increase from the visible through the Near IR and Mid-IR regions.  However, as concrete ages, it becomes darker and as asphalt ages it becomes lighter.|
|Snow and Ice|Old snow may develop a compacted crust and the moisture content increases which make it less reflective in the Near IR and Mid-IR region.  It is possible to compare old and new snow by its Mid-IR reflectance.|
